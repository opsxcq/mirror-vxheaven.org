<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to DDT</h2>
<p>At last you can read this magazine, the first one that the spanish virus writers group DDT ViRUS STUDiOS (shortened to DDT) publishes. Well, we can say you that our lifes, when making stuff for this magazine were a fucked living hell. DDT is formed by very young virus coders, working for get our own place in the scene. Btw, we are living at this moment a crisis in the VX scene: authors leaving, web sites are getting down, FBI is catching some of our partners and making publicity of it, the "freedom of speech" concept is being erased from the internet, AV companies are earning tons of money with all those scandals, i have been personally defamated publically...</p>
<p>Formed in late 1997, DDT is here and ready to rock. The first step was made by the publication of this magazine, but we won't stop here :) Our group has a defined hierarchy, where the main redactor is myself, Billy Belcebú, and followed by zAxOn as my right hand, all the another DDT members. Anyway all our decisions are made voting... ;) We are members of the Feathered Serpents Alliance (FSA). If you want more information about that just go to the Feathered Serpents' home page, in http://fly.to/serpents.org , or read the information about what the Alliance means in this same magazine.</p>
<p>It's time to take a look to the future... Well, maybe you're surprised that in this zine will be DOS viruses... Yep, but note that some of them were written some time ago, but we're now working for make some more Windows viruses, that seem to be the future of virus writing. Since 1995, the time were VLAD were rocking around and surprising the whole world with Bizatch (look Bontchy! B I Z A T C H !!!), a new breath passed through the, at that time, obsolete virus scene, with a new platform for infect, and then making the people to have a second chance in the past-frustrated tries to innovate in something... New unexplored lands, a new realm for discover... And waiting for all us. So let's join together to that party :)</p>
<p>And please, forgive us for all the misspells that we could make through this magazine, coz our mother tongue ain't english. And when reading this magazine, you must think that this is our first step in the scene (we hope that it won't be the last :P). And remember... The higher you are, the harder you fall.</p>
<p>Btw, as i heard a lot of times the same thing "What the fuck DDT handles?" and such like, i realized that i have to teach all you some chemistry :) This is the Dichlore Diphenyl Trichloretane (well, i'm not 100% sure that it's the right translation to english), and i think that you know what that was... No? DDT was an pesticide highly used in the 50-60's At that time, the DDT was legal, and besides, the ppl thought that it hasn't bad effects for humans, only for insects and plagues. But after that they found that it had several consequences to the nature, mostly because some plagues developed a way to defend theirselves againist DDT, meanwhile their natural predators didn't, so the plagues could grow a lot. Then, the DDT lost its usage, except in the cases of extreme need to kill a determinated plague in a determinated country. But this is another history. The DDT saved MILLIONS of people, for example, in the India, almost exterminating the malaria disease.</p>
<p>For what things we fight? Yep, as you can think reading this magazine, we go againist all kinds of fascisms, and da hipocrisy... But it's hard to fight with the system, so we only contribute with the thing we know to do: make viruses. We (all the VXers) are ussually labeled as data killers, terrorists, and some more things like that, but it's only because their lack of knowledge of what a virus is, because their ignorance. At Friday 13 or 5th January we must hear always the same shit... "All the computers will be infected, and all the data will be destroyed" or "Don't turn on the computer until tomorrow"... But there's always, after this shit, an AVer saying that all the problems gone with the product he's trying to sell us... "This software detects 100% of old and new viruses". Of course all the lamers go fastly to a shop for buy the shit... Almost all times that AV is a shit, and the user lives happily without knowing da truth. That is our society too, but this is another history. The lameness arrives some times until places that you can't think... Like the day Friday 13, November 1998, when Billy had to hear the comment of the guy that it's at his rigth, in his attempt to demonstrate his intelligence, said that viruses travelled by the electric net (hey! explain me how to do that! :''''''DDDDDDDD ), and when he saw me laughing a lot, he tried to explain me that viruses could appear "magically" in the computer, and after they go away... :') Well, see what ignorance does (and what a good marketing of an AV enterprise do).</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that you will enjoy this e-zine at least as we enjoyed when writing it. As you can see, we orienter many information to educational purposes in the research fields related to the "new" (relatively new) platforms, as Win32. We won't tolerate anymore that excuses, such "Windows codin is too difficult for me", because it is not. In this magazine we wanted to have many little and easily understandable tutorials about some matters related to virus coding under Win32, but without forget the content targeted to people that is beginning to be interested in virus coding. So, this mag is for all the family. Hrmm, sure? No... PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT CONTENT</p>
<p>Here in DDT we support all the freedom of speech campaigns over the net (you have an example in the Blue Ribbon's one), and of course, the freedom at all without forget that we accept critics to our job. Of course, if the critic you have is something like "You are a motherfucker", "That is shit" or something alike, you'll probably have a reply in form of a mail bombin or something cruel... We expect the "Constructive Criticism" of all you, doesn't matter what you think, if it's good or bad, about us.</p>
<p>This is the first thing of DDT being a group you can have. We worked a lot since October/November 1998, when zAxOn and me decided that the next step to do in the group was to make a magazine. Since then, we have been contacting with many people for contributions, some members joined us, some left, we appeared in the media, and, of course, we have written viruses. This is, nowadays, our humble contribution to the virus scene. Many things have changed in the virus scene since Phalcon/Skism times, many legendary groups born, many died, but the scene had been always growing. The virus scene is, as Winter said, much more compact that the other ones in the underground, the dark side of the computing. Things change in the scene, but what the people think about us outside is much more different. They generally think that we are kids with needs of fame, with the only target to destroy other's data, and the AV scene is the savior. Same lies than always, the fierce capitalism strikes again, the marketing of AV companies, as i said before. Create life, as we do, must be seen as an art, as an expression of what can do a clever mind. What's the difference between create a virus and create a human life? While creating a virus we can experiment many different feelings: happyness when something works, impotence and madness when something doesn't... Create a human life is matter of 2 seconds of absolute pleasure followed by many headaches, nights without sleep, many things you should pay and such like. Resuming, virus writing must not be seen as a terrorist act, it must be see as an expresion of what human intelligence could do, and not as a "natural-thing-that-could-occur-with-luck".</p>
<p>Btw, we have our sentence (Copyright by zAxOn/DDT) : "Think, Act, Innovate". Well, for close this article i must comment that you have entered in a world in that escape is almost impossible. You have just fallen in the net that virus writing is. You social life (?) and the rest of things of your "real" life will go hell. But you'll feel the power of control the OS, this thing that Micro$oft wants to use for control us... Remember what i am saying...</p>
<p>Hrm... Now i'm gonna tell you a little story. In this magazine we had for many months the best Win95 virus ever, the best Ring-0 virus ever (guys involved know of what virus i am talking about), and fuck, we haven't published it. Pfffff, ain't the author copyright the reason. Is the friendship with another guy that received directly from the author that virus. I'm personally very angry with the world, with my luck, and with all with two legs, two arms and a head. We were going to publish that jewel, and finally we couldn't. I feel impotent. Bah. This is the second time that this passes in this magazine. The first time, we had a very very cool virus, and another famous magazine published it before. Ok, i accepted it. We received another jewel, even more good, and happened again, another magazine is going to publish it, with author's permission. What should i do? What should we do? This situation is making me go crazy. I'd like to scream to the world a big 'FUCK YOU ALL', but i know i can't do it. Shit...</p>
<p>Heh, the worldz situation now is crazy: in the scene and outside it. For example, i have been (and i am) away from the scene, but i heard about the departure of some of the best coders of our group-brother 29A, Vecna and Z0MBiE, TI released their first e-zine, FSA continues growing, iKX and SLAM are working hard in their respectives next issues, and some viruses are in the media almost every time like Melissa, Happy99 and the classic CIH. And now some questions can be raised... Who is WM.Melissa author? Why the United States are so fascist? Why a silly macro virus can spread as fast? About the world, as most of you know there is a war between Serbia and the members of the NATO, and btw, i hate wars. But this is a virus magazine, not a political one (this suckers shouldn't exist).</p>
<p>After my words about almost all the themes i am able to think about, i will let you enjoy of one of the best e-zines you have ever read (heh... just kidding!), ehrm... almost ;) No, no, i think it has some interesting things for all people, beginners, advanced and gurus in the VX world. I have to thank (again) to all the people that made this e-zine to be a reality, and make our dream reality: to have an e-zine with some quality. (Heh, no, no... I'm not under the influence of any drug! I'm still modest ;) )</p>
