<p>This article deals with a viral technology that has been widely documented, discussed and implemented. However, it is aimed at explaining certain design flaws in current polymorphic engines and proposing solutions for these flaws, as well as suggesting improvements to current technology.</p>
<p>The discussion will present an overview of the history of polymorphism pertinent to our subject, anti-virus detection methods, and will present concepts needed for properly designing polymorphic engines with a view to their survival in the wild. It will also include a section on structuring and writing polymorphic engines.</p>
<h2><a name="c1"></a>The Evolution Of Polymorphic Engines And Their Significance</h2>
<p>The history of polymorphism began with experimentation. Virus authors recognised the susceptibility of their viruses to scan strings and encrypted their code. Even then, the decryptors were fixed, so anti-virus software generally had little trouble with a virus that was analysed and for which a scan string was extracted. A number of authors would rewrite their viruses to create strains which weren't scanned for at the time. A select few, however, started experimenting with new technology. A German programmer going by the handle of ~knzyvo} implemented dynamic encryption into his Fish family. The Whale virus, however was a more notable event. 30 different encryptors were used for this virus, which meant the anti-virus researchers had to include multiple scan strings. Dark Avenger's Phoenix family would modify bytes of their own decryptors, thus forcing anti-virus software to use wildcard scan strings. An American anti-virus researcher named Mark Washburn wrote a family of viruses that would generate a different decryptor altogether for every time the virus would replicate.</p>
<p>The real breakthrough in polymorphism was, though, the release of Dark Avenger's Mutation Engine, or MtE. This engine was distributed in a form of an object linkable to a file, and was what started the revolution in the way viruses were written. Anti-virus researchers were at a loss. The traditional methods of detection were obsolete, since this engine would have needed 4.2 billion signatures, many of which might be present in legitimate programs. Instead, most anti-virus researchers opted for methods like algorithmic scanning - checking whether or not code in question could be produced by a polymorphic engine. Several months later, anti-virus software couldn't reliably detect MtE-generated decryptors.</p>
<p>A second blow came to the anti-virus industry with the release of Trident Polymorphic Engine, written by Masud Khafir. A more complex algorithm was used for producing encryptors, and again, anti-virus researchers were left with the task of reliably detecting TPE. While the decryptors themselves weren't particularly sophisticated, they could easily be mistaken for encryption used in commercial software, and later, several other engines would be mistaken for TPE samples.</p>
<p>A new concept was introduced in 1993. Neurobasher's new Tremor virus spread widely in Germany. It seemed to researchers that a suitable algorithm was devised for its detection, yet, the virus continued to elude scannes in the wild. After thorough analysis of the virus's code, it was found that instead of generating random numbers, Tremor would use relatively immutable data to create its permutations. New strains would be generated every, say, full moon or on infecting a new system. This meant that the anti-virus researchers would need to spend even more time and effort on analysing a polymorphic virus lest they release an incomplete algorithm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the channel, a British virus writer known as the Black Baron released his polymorphic viruses built around an engine called SMEG. This engine introduced the concept of generating decryptors with large amounts of junk instructions present in the decryptors. Once again, scanners had difficulty when confronted by a new polymorphic beast. It took a much longer time to analyse a piece of code and determine whether or not it was encrypted by SMEG by picking out the decryptor from the junk.</p>
<p><em>[MGL's note: If you take closer look on SMEG, you will get the point - generated decryptors are huuuuge]</em></p>
<p>From 1992 to 1994, an unknown researcher in Uruguay busily created a family of 10 viruses, each more polymorphic than the last. The novelty of his approach rested in tracking the code that was generated, and producing decryptors that looked even more like the real thing. It became difficult to distinguish polymorphic decryptors from real code.</p>
<p>Another 1994 engine that made a significant impact on the anti-virus industry was DSCE. Dark Slayer stated that his decryptors contained no loop, key, or start-up values. In a way, he was correct. However, it's an exaggeration of what the engine really did - these structures were concealed in a massive (at the time) decryptor by point-encrypting the opcodes that resembled a decryptor loop. Once again, scanners were slowed down by having to analyse the decryptor in depth.</p>
<p>While there are several other polymorphic engines just as technically advanced as those mentioned above and the authors of which deserve just as much recognition, these are the ones that we need to illustrate the design of a solidly built polymorphic engine.</p>
<h2><a name="c2"></a>Polymorphic Virus Detection Methods</h2>
<p>So, what methods are used to detect polymorphic viruses in the wild? And what weaknesses of the polymorphic engine design do they exploit? These are questions particularly interesting to any aspiring writer of a polymorphic engine. It must be understood that anti-virus software developers often implement the lowest-grade working solutions. For instance, when Whale appeared, multiple scan strings were used instead of an algorithm. When MtE appeared, an algorithm was used instead of more sophisticated methods of analysis such as single-stepping through the decryptor or emulation of the decryptor code. So, a virus sufficiently advanced to defeat currently available methods of detection would instantly get a time window that would give it a chance to spread in the wild. Well, let's take a look at what we're up against.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Scan strings</strong></dt><dd>this is something a designer of a good polymorphic engine should not worry about. You do need to keep in mind that any sort of structured code fragments in your engine, such as anti-debugging code or anti-emulation code can be scanned for and used to aid a scanner in analysing a piece of code. A small set of fixed chunks of junk code can also be detected if the decryptor is scanned with several scan strings that allow for wildcards.</dd>
<dt><strong>Algorithmic analysis</strong></dt><dd>again, something not commonly used in our day and age. This works by analysing the code, and deducing the file is infected (or not infected) if certain conditions are met - for instance, if a decryptor structure is recognised or if the scanner finds an opcode that couldn't have possibly been generated by the engine.</dd>
<dt><strong>Statistical analysis</strong></dt><dd>this is a specialised form of algorithmic analysis that counts up the incidence of certain opcodes and code structures. This method is still used quite heavily in heuristic engines to set off an alarm if a file contains code that does not "look" naturally written or generated. Of itself, it is of little use.</dd>
<dt><strong>Int 1h tracing</strong></dt><dd>also known as single stepping. I don't know of any anti-virus scanner that uses this antiquated method of examining the code, however, Thunderbyte's TbClean program utilises the int 1h single-step mode to disinfect files. Defeating this method is simple enough, but it's usually not worth including the code, simply because it's so little-used.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cryptanalysis</strong></dt><dd>attemps to crack the virus's encryption and find a scan string underneath. While it's rarely used, it can be very effective against a fair number of polymorphic and encrypted viruses. Once again, though, defeating it isn't usually worth the effort.</dd>
<dt><strong>Heuristic scanning</strong></dt><dd>this method was originally developed to find viruses unknown to the virus scanner in question. However, the anti-virus software designers have caught on and are now using it to detect unnatural looking code which is often found in decryptors of polymorphic engines.</dd>
<dt><strong>Emulation</strong></dt><dd>this is the method currently relied on by anti-virus software to detect most polymorphic viruses. A piece of code performs the function of a fairly complete CPU and executes the code in question in a controlled environment until it deduces it has emulated far enough, at which point a scan can be performed for a fixed signature. All the work that went into a polymorphic engine goes rightdown the toilet bowl.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="c3"></a>Polymorphic Virus Detection Countermeasures</h2>
<p>A properly designed engine should aim to generate code that is as obscure and difficult to detect as possible. Here's a simple point-by-point guide to stopping most detection methods.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Scan strings</strong></dt><dd>this is should be avoided by proper engine design. By proper engine design, I mean that any and all code produced by the decryptor should be completely variable - at least one alternative per every opcode that is used for any structure.</dd>
<dt><strong>Algorithmic analysis</strong></dt><dd>this should be combatted by including at least 80% of all 80x86 opcodes, and <em>all</em> of the commonly used opcodes. The more variability here, the more difficult it is to disqualify a file as a potential carrier of the engine, therefore it becomes difficult to identify all of the infected files without false alarms.</dd>
<dt><strong>Statistical analysis</strong></dt><dd>this also depends on how the engine is structured. A few engines include a lot of one-byte instructions that mess around with the flags, nop's, hlt's, lock's, or whatever. Do not do this - any statistical scanner worth its salt will pick out the file with 25 nop's and 19 clc's in a 380-byte area of code. I'll elaborate on this in the section that describes the engine structure.</dd>
<dt><strong>Int 1h tracing</strong></dt><dd>the countermeasures for this are well-known. Most stack modification instructions, flags tests and other such anti-debugging tricks will stop a simple tracer. Prefetch queue tricks are inadvisable to use here since it is difficult to design ones that will be compatible with all processors, past, present and future.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cryptanalysis</strong></dt><dd>this technique relies on the fact that a lot of viruses will encrypt their code with simple operations like a single 8-bit xor loop. This is often true. However, doing several mathematical operations on every byte will quite easily defeat this method, as it will need to try a large number of combinations to find the right encryption algorithms and keys. The use of sliding keys once again makes the job more difficult, as the right key modification operation has to be found for every loop.</dd>
<dt><strong>Heuristic scanning</strong></dt><dd>this relates to statistical analysis, especially so in polymorphic engines. The key to avoiding producing heuristically sensitive decryptors is structuring the engine in a way that would ensure that the generated code appears to look like natural code written by a human being and assembled by an assembler. This means, among other things is that all of the opcodes a polymorphic engine generates must be in their shortest form. A point that must be noted here is that heuristical analysis is used to determine whether or not the code should be emulated. If your virus passes the heuristic checking, it won't be emulated to start with, or the emulator will stop before the virus is decrypted. The two are a part of one mechanism, where defeating one will stop analysis completely.</dd>
<dt><strong>Emulation</strong></dt><dd>defeating this method alone will significantly reduce the number of your virus samples anti-virus programs X, Y and Z will detect. To defeat this method though, one must have a good knowledge of the emulation system or systems in question. Well, here's the good news: the emulation systems used in anti-virus software are quite inferior in that they are often incomplete, sometimes buggy. This is most often intentional. Why? Well, most encrypted or polymorphic viruses use a limited instruction set in their decryptors. This means there are instructions left out of their instruction sets. The wider variety of instructions your polymorphic engine can generate (in context, of course), the better the chance of stopping an emulator. Emulators will also restrict the virus's function, so something as simple as writing to a memory location and testing the write can detect an emulator's presence. However, there's a more serious threat to an emulator attack. Most emulators are designed for speed. Therefore, a counter-attack on an emulation system that will always be effective should be designed to bleed off as much of the time as possible. This accomplishes two goals - the user will prefer a fast, unreliable scanner over a slow and reliable one, and it would take an emulator a long time to detect the virus decryptor. Of course, an emulator could time out assuming it's emulated the code too far and quit emulating, which is a complete victory for the virus author.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An example time-out attack could be orchestrated in the following fashion. The virus is encrypted and written to disk, but the key is not saved. To derive the key, some sort of checksum of the unencrypted code is saved. The virus is decrypted with a random key, the checksum is calculated, and the two checksums are compared. If the two checksums do not match, the virus is re-encrypted with the reverse operation and the process is looped back. This makes for a larger, more sophisticated loop, which an emulator must go through hundreds of times, magnifying the relative slowdown. Anti-virus emulators are built with avoiding infinite loops in mind, so perhaps an emulator will skip such a structure.</p>
<p><em>[MGL's note: For example Spanska's IDEA.6126 uses above described approach]</em></p>
<p>Another time out strategy is building complex decryptors. This will be further explained in the section dedicated to engine structure, but the premise is that the more code the emulator has to execute, the slower it will be. Therefore, a decryptor containing a moderate number of conditional jumps, calls to subroutines, and other such structures will be slower to emulate than one that's purely linear.</p>
<h2><a name="c4"></a>Designing And Structuring A Polymorphic Engine</h2>
<p>A polymorphic engine is no trivial task to write. Much of the overhead can be reduced by setting down an appropriate structure for the engine and organising it according to that.</p>
<p>The function of a polymorphic engine is to encrypt a piece of code and produce a decryptor that will then decrypt the encrypted code. The decryptor that is produced must be as variable as possible. To achieve this, and to make analysis more difficult, a polymorphic engine will usually be written to produce:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Decryptor loop</strong></dt><dd>one or several loops in the actual decryptor code that would be selected from one of several loop types where the individual instructions withing the loop would be modified. The algorithms used to perform the en/decryption would range from common XOR loops to esoteric int 1h tracers that would decrypt individual opcodes as they were executed.</dd>
<dt><strong>Junk instructions</strong></dt><dd>opcodes written in before, after or in between the decryptor loop itself to disguise the presence of the polymorphic decryptor in the infected file. This has traditionally been a problem area for most polymorphic engines, as the junk produced was not within the statistical bounds of regular code. More recently, virus writers have paid more attention to this, and more complex code structure has been created by latter-day polymorphic engines. </dd>
<dt><strong>Armouring code</strong></dt><dd>this has been widely explored, and the approach here was to traditionally generate code fragments ranging from stack tricks to int calls. The purpose here has been to stop analysis by anti-virus software and people analysing the decryptor, either by using an emulator or a real-mode debugger that would step through the code by utilising the 80x86 single-step mode.</dd>
<dt><strong>Anti-heuristic code</strong></dt><dd>I've seen only a couple of engines that use this particular sort of code. The purpose here is to obsfucate the decryptor by concealing the actual decryptor instructions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here, I would like to both compliment a virus writer for his achievement and expand on his idea to suggest a new design standard for advanced polymorphic engines. Almost 4 years ago, a virus was published in an underground virus exchange e-zine called 40Hex. The name of this virus was Level-3, and the author was then-famous Vyvojar, who had by then firmly established himself with the notable One_Half virus.</p>
<p><em>[MGL's note: according the Vyvojar One_Half virus was written to demonstrate virus with maximum spreading abilities while One_Half successor Level-3 was demonstrating use of hardcore poly encryption.]</em></p>
<p>The design of the engine was revolutionary - the engine would generate the decryptor code, and then emulate it to determine the instruction flow. This concept is quite similar to the ideas I was working on at thetime, which leads me into the design structure of an engine that would be extremely resistant to most analysis methods.</p>
<p>First of all, all of the code the engine generates would have to be emulated by its own internal emulator. This means the contents of the registers can be quite easily tracked by the emulator and the levels of complexity will be increased to a great degree. For instance, when a value like a key, start of the encrypted area, or any such area is required, the engine can quite simply fix up the values already held in the registers. The values on the stack would be emulated too. The possibilities here are really much bigger than the simple variation that can be achieved by setting down sets of rules for generating code.</p>
<p>Secondly, all of the 8086 opcodes should be produced by the engine. However, they should be produced in different frequencies - for instance, an average decryptor would usually contain about 80% of the 8086 instruction set, with the remaining 20% generated in 1 out of 20 samples. The garbage generation can be handled by building tables which would be accessed with different probabilities. Of course, producing 80386+ opcodes, or floating point coprocessor instructions would increase both variability and make the engine harder to emulate. Remember, no emulator is perfect, and most anti-virus emulators cannot handle complex instruction sets in decryptors.</p>
<p>Thridly, the structure of the decryptor itself should be complicated by such things as calls and conditional jumps. The reason for this is quite simple - it facilitates emulator slowdown. For example, 3 calls to a 20-byte subroutine are equivalent to 69 bytes of code. Conditional jumps are very useful for slowing down the process too. Emulators will attempt to emulate every path that is available if it cannot be predict the direction of the jump - a technique known as path emulation. One jump that cannot be predicted by an emulator means the decryptor will have to be emulated twice. Two such jumps mean the decryptor will have to be emulated four times. Structures like this ensure that a small decryptor may take as long to emulate as a very large decryptor.</p>
<p>Finally, a word about layers. It seems that a lot of people believe a higher number of layers will ensure adequate protection. This protection is only there in so far as the emulator will simply take as long to emulate the layers as it would for a single decryptor of the collective size of these layers. There is a restriction on the largest possible size or the largest number of layers that has to be made, and it seems optimal to maintain only two layers, one to fool heuristic scanners into thinking it's legitimate code and decrypt the second one, and the second being a simple cyclical decryptor for the rest of the virus.</p>
<p>I hope that this has given you an insight, insiration or ideas to implement. Good luck with designing your new super-polymorph. ;)</p>
